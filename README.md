# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the discpline of designing,developing and maintaining software.
its impoortance its maintainability makes it easier to fix and enhance software over time,helps in reducing development cost y minimizing errpors.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-development of programming languages
-establishment of software eng as a discipline in the 19760
-the advent of structered programming in the 1970

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-reguirements;gathering and docummenting user needs and system requirements
-desighn;creating high level ad detailed desighns of the software architecture and user interface
-implementation;writting code and building the software accortding to the desighn specifications
-testing;conducting various tests to ensure the softwware meets quality standards and function
-deployment;realesing the software to users or customers
-maitenance;providing ongoing support,updates and enhacemets to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
for waterfall the approach is by requirement ,desighn and implementation while agile is focused on flexibility, collabaration and responding to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-software developer responsible for writting code and implementing software solutions
-quality assurance engineer responsible for ensure quality by desiighning and executing test plans
-project manager all he does is to oversee the planning,execution and delivery of softare projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
importance of IDEs is to provide comprehensive tools for writting,debugging and testing code eg visual studio
importance of VCS for tracking changes to source code and coardernating work among members eg git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing of requirements during development cycle can be avoided by getting full information on the client side before starting a projecte
-tight deadline set a flexible deadline to avoid rush and prioratizationg of task

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing for testing individual components 
itergration for interactions between different components
system for tesying entire system as a whole
acceptance for testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
propt enginnering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from ai models
it helps to avoid getting confussing answers and making ypur  question clear and specific so that the ai can understand what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
give me a picture of a dog crying
give me a picture of a sad dog crying because its owner died
